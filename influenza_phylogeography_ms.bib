                   the influenza virus. Here, we extend these findings
                   to the human population level, showing that the onset
                   of increased wintertime influenza-related mortality
                   in the United States is associated with anomalously
                   low absolute humidity levels during the prior weeks.
                   We then use an epidemiological model, in which
                   observed absolute humidity conditions temper
                   influenza transmission rates, to successfully
                   simulate the seasonal cycle of observed
                   influenza-related mortality. The model results
                   indicate that direct modulation of influenza
                   transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is
                   sufficient to produce this observed seasonality.
                   These findings provide epidemiological support for
                   the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal
                   variations of influenza transmission in temperate
                   regions.},
